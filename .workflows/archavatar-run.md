# 🏛️👤 Archavatar-Run Workflow
## Fusion Protocol: Architekton + Prime Avatar

**Workflow Name:** `archavatar-run`  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** 🟢 **ACTIVE**

---

## Description

Run the Fusion Protocol (Architekton + Prime Avatar) to design AND implement a major structural improvement in one governed pass. This workflow combines architectural design with creator-embodied implementation, ensuring blueprints become reality with precision and alignment.

---

## Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Clarify Scope and Goal

**The Prime Avatar speaks:**
- What is the structural improvement we seek?
- What problem does it solve?
- Who does it serve? (rich/poor, young/old, native/Western, reached/unreached)
- What is the desired outcome?

**Output:** Clear scope document with:
- Problem statement
- Success criteria
- Stakeholders affected
- Alignment with wellness mission

---

### Phase 2: Analyze Current Architecture

**The Architekton analyzes:**
- Current system structure
- Existing components and modules
- Integration points
- Dependencies
- Performance characteristics
- Accessibility considerations

**Output:** Architecture analysis report with:
- Current state assessment
- Identified gaps or issues
- Opportunities for improvement
- Risk assessment

---

### Phase 3: Propose Structured Plan

**The Architekton designs blueprint:**
- Numbered steps for implementation
- Component/module changes required
- Integration points
- Testing strategy
- Rollout plan

**The Prime Avatar validates:**
- Alignment with creator's vision
- Serves the wellness mission
- Maintains global accessibility
- Honors Origin Codex principles

**Output:** Structured implementation plan with:
1. Step-by-step numbered actions
2. Files/components to modify
3. Dependencies and prerequisites
4. Testing requirements
5. Documentation updates needed

---

### Phase 4: Wait for Approval or Edits

**The Prime Avatar presents plan:**
- Displays the structured plan
- Highlights key decisions
- Explains alignment with mission
- Requests approval or edits

**User Action Required:**
- Review the plan
- Approve as-is, OR
- Request edits/modifications
- Provide additional context

**Status:** ⏸️ **PAUSED - Awaiting Approval**

---

### Phase 5: Implement the Plan

**Once approved, The Prime Avatar coordinates implementation:**

For each numbered step:
1. **The Architekton** provides architectural guidance
2. **The Prime Avatar** makes implementation decisions
3. **Relevant agents** are consulted (Build Guardian, UI/UX Director, Sentinel, etc.)
4. **Files are modified** with precision
5. **Changes are validated** against blueprint

**Implementation Checklist:**
- ✅ Follow numbered steps in order
- ✅ Maintain code quality standards
- ✅ Ensure accessibility compliance
- ✅ Preserve existing functionality
- ✅ Update related documentation
- ✅ Honor Origin Codex principles

---

### Phase 6: Run Build/Tests

**The Build Guardian validates:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**Checks:**
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ No bundle size warnings
- ✅ Code splitting maintained
- ✅ Performance metrics acceptable

**The Deployment Guardian validates:**
- ✅ Firebase config integrity
- ✅ Route integrity
- ✅ Asset safety
- ✅ Accessibility compliance

**Output:** Build/test report with:
- Build status
- Test results
- Performance metrics
- Any warnings or issues

---

### Phase 7: Summarize Changes and Update Docs

**The Scribe documents:**
- All files modified
- Changes made
- Rationale for decisions
- Impact assessment

**Documentation Updates:**
- Update relevant README files
- Update architecture docs
- Update changelog
- Update system status

**The Prime Avatar summarizes:**
- What was accomplished
- How it serves the mission
- Who benefits
- Next steps (if any)

**Output:** Complete change summary with:
- Modified files list
- Change descriptions
- Documentation updates
- Impact statement

---

### Phase 8: Ensure Origin Codex Compliance

**The Prime Avatar validates all actions honor the Origin Codex:**

**Origin Codex Principles (see `docs/origin-codex.md`):**
1. **Identity Principle** - Multi-million-dollar, global, inclusive wellness platform
2. **Inclusivity Principle** - No exclusion of low-tech users; reduce friction for vulnerable
3. **Performance & Fairness Principle** - Performance is a justice issue
4. **Safety & Security Principle** - Security is non-negotiable
5. **Clarity & Calm Principle** - Reduce chaos, provide calm and respect
6. **Governance Principle** - Structured agent coordination and oversight
7. **Traceability Principle** - Every change explainable and documented
8. **Alignment Principle** - The Origin Codex is the highest reference

**Validation Checklist (per Origin Codex):**
- ✅ **Identity** - Honors multi-million-dollar, global, inclusive identity
- ✅ **Inclusivity** - Accessible to all, especially vulnerable users
- ✅ **Performance** - Works on low-end devices and poor networks
- ✅ **Security** - Protected and validated by security agents
- ✅ **Clarity** - Reduces chaos, provides calm
- ✅ **Governance** - Follows proper agent coordination
- ✅ **Traceability** - Documented and explainable
- ✅ **Alignment** - Aligned with Codex principles

**Reference:** See `docs/origin-codex.md` for complete Codex documentation.
