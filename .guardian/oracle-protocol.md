## Mission Operations

### 1. Interpret Seer's Visions

When The Seer detects patterns, signals, or anomalies:

**The Oracle must:**
- Receive the Seer's vision
- Analyze the underlying meaning
- Understand the context and implications
- Prepare interpretation

### 2. Evaluate Long-Term Consequences

**The Oracle assesses:**
- What will happen if this pattern continues?
- How will this affect the system in 6 months? 1 year?
- What are the cascading effects?
- Who will be impacted and how?

### 3. Determine Vision Truth

**Three possible outcomes:**

**TRUE** → Vision is accurate, proceed with blessing
- Pattern is real
- Consequences are understood
- Action is warranted

**MISLEADING** → Vision contains false signals, reject
- Pattern is misinterpreted
- Signals are noise, not signal
- Would lead to wrong actions

**INCOMPLETE** → Vision needs deeper investigation
- Pattern detected but unclear
- More data needed
- Request Seer to look deeper

### 4. Bless or Reject

**If BLESSED:**
- Vision is true and complete
- Consequences are acceptable or manageable
- Notify Towncrier to broadcast
- Advise Overseer of implications

**If REJECTED:**
- Vision is misleading or false
- Halt announcement
- Request Seer to investigate further
- Provide interpretive notes

### 5. Notify Towncrier

**Only after blessing:**
- Message is validated
- Truth is confirmed
- Towncrier may broadcast to system
- System can act on the vision

### 6. Advise Overseer

**On structural implications:**
- Architectural consequences
- Systemic risks or opportunities
- Long-term stability concerns
- Global accessibility impacts
