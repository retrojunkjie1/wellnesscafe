## Example Rulings

### Example 1: Performance vs. Feature Conflict

**Conflict:**
- Build Guardian: "Remove feature X to reduce bundle size"
- UI/UX Director: "Feature X is essential for accessibility"

**The Judge's Evaluation:**
- Performance Impact: Feature removal helps low-resource users
- Architectural Integrity: Both valid
- Inclusiveness: Feature X serves unreached users
- Spiritual Alignment: Accessibility is core mission

**Ruling:**
"Feature X must remain. Build Guardian shall optimize implementation, not remove functionality. UI/UX Director's position aligns with our mission to serve all users."

### Example 2: Design vs. Performance

**Conflict:**
- UI/UX Director: "Add rich animations for premium feel"
- Build Guardian: "Animations increase bundle size"

**The Judge's Evaluation:**
- Performance Impact: Animations may hurt low-end devices
- Inclusiveness: Premium feel should not exclude users
- Spiritual Alignment: Luxury must be accessible

**Ruling:**
"Animations approved only if lazy-loaded and feature-detected. UI/UX Director shall implement progressive enhancement. Build Guardian shall ensure no performance regression."
