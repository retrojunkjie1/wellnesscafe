Some programs even have combined applications to make it easier.'},{question:"What if I'm denied? Can I appeal?",answer:"Absolutely. You have the right to appeal any denial decision. Most programs give you 30-90 days to file an appeal. Request a copy of the decision notice explaining why you were denied.

Legal aid organizations can help with appeals for free."},{question:"Will receiving benefits affect my immigration status?",answer:"This depends on your immigration status and the benefit. Many benefits do NOT count under public charge rules, including: Medicaid (with exceptions), CHIP, SNAP, housing assistance (in most cases), and emergency services.

If concerned, consult with an immigration attorney or accredited representative before applying."},{question:"Do I need to repay assistance benefits?",answer:"No, most assistance programs are grants, not loans. SNAP, Medicaid, housing vouchers, and utility assistance do not need to be repaid. However, if you receive benefits you weren't eligible for due to fraud or failure to report changes, you may have to repay. Some programs like TANF have work requirements.
